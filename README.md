# Running-pytorch-lightning-on-GPU-cluster

This repository is intended to guide users to run their pytorch lightning codes on Neuron. [Pytorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/index.html) is a lightweight wrapper or interface on top of PyTorch, which simplifies the implementation of complex deep learning models. It is a PyTorch extension that enables researchers and practitioners to focus more on their research and less on the engineering aspects of deep learning. PyTorch Lightning automates many of the routine tasks, such as distributing training across multiple GPUs, logging, and checkpointing, so that the users can focus on writing high-level code for their models.

## KISTI Neuron GPU Cluster
Neuron is a KISTI GPU cluster system consisting of 65 nodes with 260 GPUs (120 of NVIDIA A100 GPUs and 140 of NVIDIA V100 GPUs). [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) is adopted for cluster/resource management and job scheduling.

## Installing Conda
Once logging in to Neuron, you will need to have either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your scratch directory. Anaconda is distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, aiming to simplify package management and deployment. Anaconda comes with +150 data science packages, whereas Miniconda, a small bootstrap version of Anaconda, comes with a handful of what's needed.

1. Check the Neuron system specification
```
[glogin01]$ cat /etc/*release*
CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core)
Derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.8 (Source)

```

2. Download Anaconda or Miniconda. Miniconda comes with python, conda (package & environment manager), and some basic packages. Miniconda is fast to install and could be sufficient for distributed deep learning training practices. 
```
# (option 1) Anaconda 
[glogin01]$ cd /scratch/$USER  ## Note that $USER means your user account name on Neuron
[glogin01]$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
```
# (option 2) Miniconda 
[glogin01]$ cd /scratch/$USER  ## Note that $USER means your user account name on Neuron
[glogin01]$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

3. Install Miniconda. By default conda will be installed in your home directory, which has a limited disk space. You will install and create subsequent conda environments on your scratch directory. 
```
[glogin01]$ chmod 755 Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
[glogin01]$ ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

Welcome to Miniconda3 py39_4.12.0

In order to continue the installation process, please review the license
agreement.
Please, press ENTER to continue
>>>                               <======== press ENTER here
.
.
.
Do you accept the license terms? [yes|no]
[no] >>> yes                      <========= type yes here 

Miniconda3 will now be installed into this location:
/home01/qualis/miniconda3        

  - Press ENTER to confirm the location
  - Press CTRL-C to abort the installation
  - Or specify a different location below

[/home01/qualis/miniconda3] >>> /scratch/$USER/miniconda3  <======== type /scratch/$USER/miniconda3 here
PREFIX=/scratch/qualis/miniconda3

installation finished.
Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3
by running conda init? [yes|no]
[no] >>> yes         <========== type yes here
.
.
.
If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup,
   set the auto_activate_base parameter to false:

conda config --set auto_activate_base false

Thank you for installing Miniconda3!
```

4. finalize installing Miniconda with environment variables set including conda path

```
[glogin01]$ source ~/.bashrc    # set conda path and environment variables 
[glogin01]$ conda config --set auto_activate_base false
[glogin01]$ which conda
/scratch/$USER/miniconda3/condabin/conda
[glogin01]$ conda --version
conda 4.12.0
```

## Installing Pytorch Lightning
Now you are ready to build Horovod as a conda virtual environment: 
1. load modules: 
```
module load gcc/10.2.0 cuda/11.7
```
2. create a new conda virtual environment and activate the environment:
```
[glogin01]$ conda create -n lightning
[glogin01]$ conda activate lightning
```
3. install the pytorch and lightning package:
```
(lightning) [glogin01]$ conda install pytorch==1.13.0 torchvision==0.14.0 torchaudio==0.13.0 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
(lightning) [glogin01]$ pip install lightning
```
4. check if the pytorch lightning packages were installed:
```
(lightning) [glogin01]$ conda list | grep lightning
# packages in environment at /scratch/$USER/miniconda3/envs/lightning:
lightning                 2.0.2                    pypi_0    pypi
lightning-cloud           0.5.36                   pypi_0    pypi
lightning-utilities       0.8.0                    pypi_0    pypi
pytorch-lightning         2.0.2                    pypi_0    pypi
```
